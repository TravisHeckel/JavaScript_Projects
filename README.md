This repository contains all practice work used during lessons and several large projects I built.

## Projects

[Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/TravisHeckel/JavaScript_Projects/tree/main/TicTacToe)

The classic game of tic-tac-toe. IT randomly rolls die to select which of the two players goes first and then users are off playing the classic game. Users can decide which token each player wants to use and the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.

[Pizza project](https://github.com/TravisHeckel/JavaScript_Projects/tree/main/Pizza_Project)

This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings. it then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.

[Calculator](https://github.com/TravisHeckel/JavaScript_Projects/tree/main/Calculator)

A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.


[To-Do application](https://github.com/TravisHeckel/JavaScript_Projects/tree/main/todo_app)

This allows for you to build a list of tasks you need to remember and allows for you to remove any of them at will without ruining the list.
